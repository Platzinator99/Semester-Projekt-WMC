# Semester-Projekt-WMC
This is my website for the WMC course at HTL Bulme Graz.
The task was to create a website with several HTML files and a CSS file containing the design.
Since I have always been particularly creative but never had the courage to do anything with it, I thought this project would be a good start.
I have uploaded some of my drawings and maybe there will be more in the future, regardless of my grade ;)
